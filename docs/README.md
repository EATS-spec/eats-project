## 💡 Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows a principle of **clarity through organization**:

- **Architecture** - Understanding the "why" and "how"
- **Guides** - Step-by-step implementation details
- **Planning** - Future vision and roadmap
- **Archive** - Historical context and completed work

For project-specific documentation (deployment, testing, monitoring), see the `docs/` folders within each project.
